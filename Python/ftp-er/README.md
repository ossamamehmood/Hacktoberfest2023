# FTP-er

FTP-er is a Python script for creating FTP servers.

## Purpose
FTP-er can be used for file transfers, CTFs, and various other purposes. However, please note that if you use it for illegal activities, I do not assume any responsibility.

## Usage
The program will prompt you for the required parameters during execution.


## Warning!
Always exercise caution to prevent unauthorized access to your files or the injection of malware. Ensure that you do not forget about any servers you have running.

## Additional Information
Most of the code used in this project was sourced online. I customized it and added user input. Currently, the script is designed for Linux, and its compatibility with Windows is uncertain, as CTFs are typically not played on windows. Idk if it works on Windows so if you want you can try it. ;)
