# Simple Java Chat Application

This is a basic client-server chat application implemented in Java, where clients can connect to a server and exchange messages. This README provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Client Code

The `Client` class in the `Client.java` file represents the client-side of the chat application. It connects to a specific server IP address and port (currently set to 216.24.57.3 and 8080) and allows the user to send and receive messages. Here's an overview of the client code:

- Creates a socket connection to the server.
- Sets up input and output streams for communication.
- Handles reading and writing messages in separate threads.
- Gracefully handles errors and exits on exceptions.

## Server Code

The `Server` class in the `Server.java` file represents the server-side of the chat application. It listens for incoming client connections and handles messages from clients. Here's an overview of the server code:

- Creates a `ServerSocket` to listen for client connections on port 6666.
- Accepts client connections and sets up input and output streams for communication.
- Handles reading and writing messages in separate threads.
- Gracefully handles errors and closes resources upon exceptions.

## Usage

1. Compile the code: To compile the code, make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can compile the code using the following commands in your terminal:
   
   For the client:
   
   ```bash
   javac Client.java
   ```

For the server:

```bash
javac Server.java
```

- Start the server: Run the server first by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java Server
```

- Start the client: Open a new terminal window and run the client:
  
  ```bash
  java Client
  ```
* Chat: You can now exchange messages between the server and client. Type messages in the client terminal to send them to the server, and vice versa.

* Terminate: To exit the chat, simply type "exit" in the client's terminal. The server and client will gracefully close the connection.

## Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling, including better error messages and handling network-related issues.

- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper resource management by explicitly closing sockets, input/output streams, and the server socket when they are no longer needed.

- **Thread Safety**: If you plan to handle multiple client connections, make sure to handle multithreading issues and synchronization.

- **Security**: For real-world applications, consider implementing secure connections (e.g., SSL/TLS) to protect the data being transmitted.

- **User Interface**: Enhance the user experience by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) or using an advanced text-based interface.

This chat application provides a basic foundation, and you can expand and enhance it based on your requirements and use case.
